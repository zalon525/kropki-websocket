# kropki-websocket
A very simple WebSocket multiplayer browser game

Inspired by [kropki](https://github.com/zalon525/kropki), which is a Java 2d game engine, **kropki-websocket** is an attempt at taking the gameplay to the multiplayer level.

In order to play just run the server (with Python 3 interpreter) and view index.html in your browser.
